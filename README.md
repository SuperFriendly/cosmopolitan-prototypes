The Cosmopolitan Prototypes
===================
Prototypes for The Cosmopolitan Identity Online project.

Rules
-------------------
- PRs are unneccessary and discouraged. Just work.
- Branches are fine, but commit back into master. Again, just work.
- One directory per platform (e.g. `python`, `ios`, `web`)
- Subdirectories should be formatted as such: JK001BriefDescription
	- Begin with your initials.
	- Add a three digit incrementing number, so everyone can see progress.
	- Add a brief description of what the prototype does.
	- Each subdirectory should ideally contain a README.md explaining what the prototype does.
	- Feel free to riff on one other's prototypes.
